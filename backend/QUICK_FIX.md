# 🚨 Quick Fix for Save Medicine Issue

## The Problem
Your MongoDB connection is failing because the password is missing from the connection string.

## 🔧 Quick Solution

### Step 1: Set Your MongoDB Password
Run this command in the backend directory:
```bash
node setup-mongodb.js
```
Then enter your MongoDB Atlas password when prompted.

### Step 2: Start the Server
```bash
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test the Save Medicine Feature
1. Open your frontend at `http://localhost:5173`
2. Login with your credentials
3. Go to "Medicines" tab
4. Try adding a new medicine - it should work now!

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

1. **MongoDB Connection**: Updated connection string to include your password
2. **Doses Route**: Converted from SQLite to MongoDB
3. **Medicine Routes**: Already converted to MongoDB
4. **Authentication**: Already working with MongoDB

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

After fixing the password:
- ✅ Server starts without MongoDB errors
- ✅ Save Medicine button works
- ✅ Medicines are stored in MongoDB Atlas
- ✅ All CRUD operations work properly

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues

1. **Check your MongoDB Atlas password** - make sure it's correct
2. **Verify network access** - ensure your IP is whitelisted in Atlas
3. **Check the connection string** - make sure it matches your Atlas cluster

## 📊 Your MongoDB Atlas Setup
- **Cluster**: Cluster0
- **Database**: medicine-adherence
- **Collections**: users, medicines, doses

The app will automatically create these collections when you start using it!
